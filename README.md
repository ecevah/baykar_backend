# Baykar Web Development Specialist Backend Technical Interview

As part of Baykar's web development specialist backend technical interview, we aim to develop an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) rental system using Python, Django, PostgreSQL, and REST framework. By accessing the `django_project` and `Baykar_reservation_front` files, you can find documents containing their respective documentation. This system consists of a backend containing basic reservation functions and a frontend aiming to visualize data.

## Details:

- **Backend Section:** It features a reservation system developed using Python and Django.
- **Database Management:** PostgreSQL is used for managing the database.
- **REST Framework:** It facilitates communication between the frontend and backend via APIs.
